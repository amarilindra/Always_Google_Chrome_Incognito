# Always Launch Google Chrome in Incognito Mode

Privacy is what we all need in this internet era and Incognito Mode (Private browsing) on Google Chrome partially helps in achieving it.

Here is how you can by default open Google Chrome in Incognito mode on Mac, Windows, Linux, Android, and iOS/iPadOS.

## macOS

Achieving this behavior is simple on Windows, Linux, Android, and iOS. 

However, in macOS, we need to make use of the Automator app and a simple shell script for the same.

I have made a simple Automator app for macOS named **Google Chome Incognito** to make things easier.

To use this Automator app, click on the above button and download **Google Chrome Incognito.zip** file to your device. Extract it and you find the **Google Chrome Incognito**

Replace the old Chrome icon with the Google Chrome Incognito you just downloaded. Clicking on it always launch the Google Chrome in Incognito mode.
